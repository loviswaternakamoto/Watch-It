# UI Design

Look-and-feel target: the Plex/Emby/Silo "streaming service" aesthetic — dark theme,
poster art everywhere, minimal chrome.

## Design language

Colours, fonts, and type scale live in **[BRAND.md](BRAND.md)** — W@tch follows
the etchit.io family design language (fetch>it / etch/it): warm near-black
"ink" surfaces, bone-white text, blue `#42a5f5` accent (a deliberate divergence from the family copper — see BRAND.md), system UI fonts,
mono for content addresses, the `W@tch` wordmark in Anton (since 2026-07-31; formerly lowercase mono `watch-it`).

- **Dark-first.** `--ink` (#0a0a0a) canvas, poster art provides the colour.
  Three themes (dark / dim / light), dark default.
- **One accent — blue** (#42a5f5; #1976d2 in the light theme): distinct from Plex yellow-orange,
  Jellyfin purple, Emby green; used for play/focus/progress only, never
  large surfaces.
- Poster cards with rounded corners, hover/focus scale on desktop, watched-progress bar
  along the card bottom (accent fill), unwatched-count badge for shows.
- **Download/offline state on every card**: small badge (ash outline = stream-only,
  green check = downloaded, accent progress ring = downloading).
- **Three viewing registers** when a UI surfaces a choice: New bee
  (default — view / emotion / choose-click, never numbered steps),
  Raver (tighter, same doors), Cypherpunk (full technical density).
  Public vs private provenance is a badge plus plain language
  (New bee: “Shared”; Cypherpunk: “public XOR”) — amber like other
  public surfaces, never a scare-label.
- **Adoption promise** is felt on empty walls and My Media:
  “Make something beautiful. Give someone a piece of it. Stay
  connected to its maker.” Receiving a public address is Keep, not
  a devops paste-XOR chore.

## Screens

### 1. Home
- Top row: **Continue Watching** (landscape thumbnails with progress bars)
- **Recently Added** per list
- **Next Up** (next unwatched episode per show)
- List switcher in the sidebar/drawer: All · <list name> · <list name> · Downloads
- Desktop (alpha.94): home windows ≥1000 logical px keep the library
  drawer **pinned open** as a 290px side panel beside the wall — the
  burger sits on the far left of the app bar and toggles it (remembered
  across launches), search moves to the right. Narrower windows and
  mobile keep the modal drawer with the old layout (search left, burger
  far right)

### 2. Library grid
- Poster wall, infinite scroll, alphabet fast-scroller on the right
- Filter/sort bar: category/genre, year, watched state, downloaded-only,
  A-Z / recently added / rating

### 3. Detail page (movie / show)
- Backdrop art with gradient into the page
- Poster, title, year, runtime, rating badges, category/genre chips, overview
  (all fetched from TMDB by file name)
- Big **Play / Resume** button + **Download** button (or Remove Download / progress)
- For shows: season tabs → episode list with thumbnails and per-episode watched state
- Derived address shown (copyable; the entry's content identity)

### 4. Add / manage lists
- **Add entry**: multi-select `.datamap` file picker (the file name carries the
  media name → metadata matches automatically); no address is ever typed
- **Import**: "Add .datamap files" or "Import .watch-list bundle" (local
  file); zip magic sniffed, extension irrelevant
- **Export**: `.watch-list` bundle only, with a watch-history checkbox
  (default off), root maps (default on); see
  [BUNDLE-FORMAT.md](BUNDLE-FORMAT.md)
- Reorder, rename, delete lists; re-run metadata match on an entry

### 5. Player
- Video fills the window/screen; controls auto-hide
- Bottom bar: seek bar with chapter markers, play/pause, ±10s skip, audio track,
  subtitle track, speed, volume, fullscreen
- Buffering indicator distinguishes network fetch from decode stalls
- Desktop: full keyboard map (space, ←/→, f, m, s, numbers = percent-seek — mpv-style)
- Mobile: gestures — swipe left edge = brightness, right edge = volume, horizontal =
  seek, double-tap sides = ±10s
- TV (Android TV remote): select = play/pause, ←/→ = seek (hold to accelerate),
  ↑/↓ = show controls / up-next, back = dismiss controls then exit player;
  media keys (play/pause/FF/RW) mapped directly
- "Up next" card in the last 30 seconds of an episode

### 6. Settings
- CONTENT section (renamed from LIBRARY 2026-08-30) order: Channels
  (public, amber, on top) · My W@tch (the two sharing surfaces sit
  together, public above private) · My Media (renamed from Media) ·
  Upload (desktop-only, moved out of the home drawer) · Downloads
  (queue/storage/behaviour tile, moved in from its own DOWNLOADS
  section 2026-08-30 — sits below My Media, and below Upload where
  that shows). The drawer is connection status + list navigation +
  Settings: since 2026-08-30 the dot-style status rows lead the drawer
  ABOVE the Library list section (they sat below Settings 2026-08-29,
  and on the home screen's bar before that) — Autonomi peers
  ("Connected · N peers"), My W@tch (sync state, tap opens the page,
  "not linked" when unlinked, "switched off" when disabled in the x0x
  client page), and a Channels row (gossip network state, tap opens
  Channels, "switched off" when disabled); the home screen has no
  status bar anymore
- Lists (manage, import/export)
- Network (slimmed to three tiles in the 2026-09-06 Data-page merge,
  which absorbed the 2026-09-05 reorg's four sub-pages): **Offline
  mode** on top (the all-network pause switch), then **Data**, then
  **Buffer size**. The Data sub-page is the one place for everything
  data, top to bottom: the live usage counters (total card,
  per-component rows with Off tags, current-rate row, Since <date> +
  Reset), the Auto-pause-when-idle tile, a BUILT-IN CLIENTS section —
  Autonomi connection row with refresh, then Channels and My W@tch
  each on a compact 3-segment pill **Off | Wi-Fi | Wi-Fi + mobile**
  (replacing the old on/off switch + separate cellular toggle; links,
  keys and subscriptions are kept while Off, joining / creating /
  subscribing flips the matching switch back on automatically, and a
  channel update published while Channels is off waits and is
  announced on re-enable) — and a MOBILE DATA section (Streaming Ask
  first / Allowed / Wi-Fi only + Downloads pickers). A feature set to
  Wi-Fi is paused on cellular by the X0xCellularGate and resumed the
  moment Wi-Fi returns — its pill then reads Wi-Fi with a "Paused on
  mobile data" line, never Off, and an explicit Off is never
  overridden by the gate. The live network-stack versions moved to
  Settings → About (2026-09-06): the Version tile expands to App +
  ant-core / x0x / saorsa-core / saorsa-gossip / ant-quic with a
  Copy-versions button for bug reports; the numbers come from the
  core's open `GET /versions` route, baked out of Cargo.lock at build
  time so they can never drift from what actually shipped
- Wallet (renamed from Publishing 2026-08-27: create with 12-word
  ceremony + retype confirm, import key/phrase, live ANT/ETH balances,
  remove; one wallet will fund both private uploads and the planned
  public Channels)
- Playback (hardware decode, default subtitle language, skip amounts)
- Appearance (Colour scheme; sits below Metadata since 2026-08-30).
  **Viewing style** is the three-register chrome — New bee (default,
  calm, never numbered steps), Raver, Cypherpunk — same doors, three
  densities. Lives on My Media and the Receive sheet; persisted
  per-profile like the colour scheme.
- About / licenses (incl. TMDB attribution notice + logo; the Terms of
  Use & Disclaimer page — also gated on first launch; update-check
  toggle + "Update available" row on desktop; since 2026-09-06 the
  Version tile expands to the full network-stack versions with a
  Copy-versions button)

### 7. Upload (desktop, alpha.55+; renamed from Publish 2026-08-27;
###    one flow since 2026-09-02)
- Settings → CONTENT tile below My Media (desktop-only; lived in the
  home drawer until 2026-08-29), subtitle "Private · only your
  devices" — the word "publish" is reserved for the public Channels
- ONE way in: "Upload files or folders" opens the batch uploader
  (auto naming/metadata via MusicBrainz/TMDB, content-hash ledger
  dedup, unattended paid batch, .watch-list bundle). The old separate
  tier-encoding flow was deleted 2026-09-02 — quality versions live on
  the batch review page now. The Upload page also points at files
  from earlier uploads still needing attention. While a session is
  running (or finished unseen) the doorway swaps the fresh-start
  button for a live "Upload in progress" card + "Return to the
  upload" (state-aware since 2026-09-02). The uploader itself is
  titled plain "Upload" — the word "batch" is kept out of all
  user-facing copy.
- Batch setup: Add files / Add a folder, target-list choice as
  done-page-style buttons (`Add to "Music"` + "Choose another
  list…"; music-heavy picks default to Music), and a
  needs-attention card listing earlier batches with a per-batch
  Review button (re-runs matching over just those files under the
  original list)
- Matching: auto-accepts id-backed high-confidence matches; everything
  else queues into a "Review matches · N of M" carousel after the
  scan — back/forward arrows revisit any card, answering a decided
  card replaces the earlier answer, and review-page rows reopen their
  card on tap. Auto-accepts are never silent (2026-09-02): they get a
  pre-decided card too, review rows show the matched artwork inline,
  and reopening lets a wrong automatic answer be replaced. Music is
  reviewed one whole album at a time.
- Review page: per-output list, QUALITY checkboxes for video entries
  (Medium/Low/High offered per probe, H.264+AAC MP4, never upscaled;
  Original as-is; each tier uploads per video and folds into the
  version picker), tier-aware live cost estimate, rights/permanence
  confirm gate
- Upload: encodes tiers on the fly, one manifest/ledger/bundle row per
  output; done page reports the automatic add to the chosen list
  ("Added N titles to …"), keeps "Add to other lists…" / "Save
  bundle to…", and Done returns to the home wall
- The running batch lives in an app-wide session (2026-08-30):
  leaving the page mid-upload loses nothing — returning shows the
  batch where it stands

### 8. My W@tch (alpha.61/.62)
- Lives under Settings → CONTENT, directly below Channels, since
  2026-08-29 (was Settings → Network since alpha.63; desktop +
  Android). When its pill is set to Off in Settings → Network → Data
  (the Built-in x0x client switch until 2026-09-06), the linked view
  shows a "switched off" card instead of the connecting spinner.
- Unlinked: **Link this device** (names the device, shows the invite as
  a QR code + copyable `wtch1-…` code) or **Join** (paste the code, or
  scan the QR with the camera on Android/iOS)
- Linked: Last sync / Linked since, a row per device with online dot,
  last-heard time, and list/item counts; Show invite, **Sync now**, and
  Unlink (with confirm)
- Sync itself is invisible: a background cycle keeps lists, viewing
  positions, edits, and artwork current whenever linked devices are
  online together — the page never needs to be open

### 9. Channels (shipped 2026-08-27, alpha.65)
- Settings → CONTENT tile **Channels** at the top of the section
  (amber icon, "Public · anyone with the code") — a separate door from
  the blue Upload tile on purpose; every channel surface carries an
  amber PUBLIC/CHANNEL badge
- Always-visible connection bar under the segment switch (2026-08-29):
  green dot "Connected to the channel network" / amber spinner
  "Connecting…" / grey "Not connected — connects when you create or
  add a channel"
- Channels carry NO category tags (2026-08-29): the Describe page has
  no genre chips, manifests publish `category: null`, and channel list
  pages never show the genre chip row
- **Channel profile** (2026-08-29): a channel has a face — a circular
  avatar (still image, forced 1:1 crop, ≤2 MB — the FIRST and ONLY
  circular artwork in the app: circles mean channel identity,
  rectangles mean media), an optional author name-or-handle rendered
  as "by <author>" wherever set (unset → the line simply doesn't
  render), plus the existing name/description. Create form = profile
  form (96px circular picker with amber ring + camera badge, author
  field marked optional/public/permanent); My Channel gains **Edit
  channel details** — edits are staged locally and go public with the
  next publish (the manifest is rebuilt on every head, so the profile
  rides it; a changed avatar is a new content-hash member, an
  unchanged one is skipped by the delta fetch). A channel's list page
  opens with the full-width **channel info card** above the poster
  grid: 72px avatar, name, "by author · N entries", description (2
  lines, tap to expand), and the copyable `wchn1-` code in amber mono
  — deliberate anti-impersonation UI: there is no handle registry and
  no uniqueness, anyone can type any author name, so the code stays
  the only real identity and is always in sight (the app bar drops its
  entry-count subtitle there; the card owns it). Mini avatars
  (podcasts-icon fallback) on the channels-screen cards, the drawer's
  channel rows, the My Media rows, and the home wall's channel row
  titles (18px beside the CHANNEL badge). The FirstPublishGate warning
  list includes the profile: channel name — and author/avatar if set —
  are published publicly and permanently.
- **Subscribed** segment (default, all platforms): channel cards with
  name/description/item count/update state, Add channel (paste
  `wchn1-…` or scan QR on mobile, with the content-comes-from-the-owner
  note); subscribed channels render on the home wall + drawer as
  read-only amber-badged lists that update automatically — a freshly
  added channel surfaces at the TOP of both until reordered in
  Settings → Home screen (the drawer always mirrors the home screen's
  row order and visibility)
- **My Channel** segment (desktop): Create channel → name/description →
  12-word key ceremony (show → retype 3) → full-screen
  public/permanent/attributable gate confirmed by typing the channel
  name; then code + QR to share, backup-status row, the item list
  subscribers see, "Publish an item" (a LOCAL FILE first, the Upload
  flow's shape: choose a file → quality tiers to encode → required
  Describe-this-item, whose Check TMDB button fills title/description/
  artwork from a previewed TMDB match → rights attestation → encode +
  upload → staged, with an optional add-to-library leg; "Add an item
  already in the library" keeps the picker for existing uploads —
  list first, then the list's items as the editor's nested tree:
  artist → album → track, show → season → episode, versions folded) and
  "Publish update" with a live cost preview; Restore channel by phrase
- Settings is untouched — publishing is an activity, not a setting

### 10. Profiles (alpha.93)

Netflix-style viewing profiles for family devices — invisible until a
second profile exists (a pre-profile install is silently the lone
"Admin" profile).

- **"Who's w@tching?"** full-screen picker at launch when several
  profiles exist and none is set to auto-select; the heading is in the
  wordmark's own treatment since alpha.94 (Anton, bone, the @ in accent
  blue — the one sanctioned Anton use outside the wordmark); circular
  avatars (12 drawn presets or a forced-square image crop), lock icon
  on PIN-protected profiles, "Kids" tag under kid profiles
- **Switch button** in the home app bar: the active profile's avatar
  (only when 2+ profiles). Leaving a KID profile prompts for the admin
  PIN when one is set
- **Settings → Profiles** (admin only, tops the Settings page):
  profile list, Add profile (name → type Kid|Adult → avatar → allowed
  lists for kids → auto-select → PIN), Admin PIN with one-time
  recovery code ("Forgot PIN?" on the admin prompt takes the code)
- **Kid profiles**: wall/drawer/search show only allow-listed lists;
  Downloads (row, indicator, buttons) and edit surfaces hidden
  entirely; settings restricted
- **Non-admin settings**: Switch profile + Appearance + Buffer size +
  About (minus Clear all data)
- Watch positions, favourites and colour scheme are per profile;
  library, downloads, wallet, channels and the network identity are
  shared (profiles, not accounts)
- **Family export/import** (alpha.95): the Export-library dialog gains
  an opt-in **Include profiles** checkbox (default off, "Never share
  this bundle"); the import dialog then offers **Profiles (N)**.
  Profiles merge by name and the device always wins on a clash — a
  backup PIN or avatar only fills a gap, kid allow-lists union, and
  the admin PIN travels together with its recovery code so "Forgot
  PIN?" keeps working on the new device

## Layout adaptation

| | Mobile (Android/iOS) | Desktop (Linux/Win/Mac) | TV (Android TV, 10-foot) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Nav | bottom tab bar (Home · Library · Search · Settings) | slim left sidebar | left rail, collapsed to icons; D-pad only |
| Grid | 3 posters wide | responsive, 6–10 wide | 5–6 wide, focused card scales + accent focus ring |
| Detail | vertical scroll | two-column hero | full-bleed backdrop, focusable button row |
| Player | gesture-driven | keyboard + mouse hover | remote-driven (see Player above) |
| Input | touch | keyboard + mouse | D-pad focus traversal; every action reachable without a pointer |

TV notes: larger base type scale (readable at 3 m), no hover-only affordances, text
entry kept to add/import flows only (paste via network share or a shown-on-TV import
address is preferred over typing addresses with a remote).

Shipped so far for TV (alpha.95): the leanback launcher entry + TV
banner (a centred bucket-and-wordmark lockup on ink) and a visible
accent focus ring with select-activation on every wall card, so the
library browses by D-pad/remote today — running the *normal* layout;
the 10-foot column above remains the target.

## Built so far (alpha.95)

The home poster wall (with show-level grouping and Continue Watching /
Recently Added rows), big-artwork Show → Season → Detail pages (TMDB ratings,
air dates, episode screenshots, Resume / Start over, Watched badge, Next
episode), the player with buffering overlay, resume-from-saved-position and
the end-of-episode Up-next auto-play card, the Media Lists management page
(create/hide/rename/delete, datamap/bundle import — local or by network
address — per-list bundle export), and Settings (network status, metadata key,
Downloads queue page, size on disk + factory reset) are all live on Android
and Linux. Downloads shipped in alpha.30/.31: a Download button with
progress on detail pages, download badges on every card (accent check =
downloaded, progress ring = downloading, any-downloaded count on show/season
cards), downloaded titles playing locally, and offline gating — browsing
always works, Play is disabled with a hint on non-downloaded titles when
offline. Alpha.32 added a season download-all button, a Downloads row on the
home wall, multi-select/delete-all in the downloads queue, and a top-bar
download meter. Alpha.33 added `.watch-list` bundle export/import (two-step
Export dialog, one auto-detecting Import button) on the Media Lists page,
TMDB attribution in Settings → About, and the Linux taskbar icon.
Alpha.34 added keyless releases (with the dismissible TMDB nudge banner),
show-level Download All, home-row customization (Settings → Home screen:
reorder + show/hide rows), and the 8px watch-progress bar on all cards.
Alpha.35 ships home-page library search (docs/PLAN-home-search.md) —
search icon in the home app bar (`/` or Ctrl+F on desktop) opening a
full-screen live search over the library, grouped Shows / Movies /
Episodes with download/watched badges. Alpha.36 ships the striped
popcorn-bucket logo — launcher/taskbar icon on Android and Linux plus the
icon + wordmark lockup in the home app bar — and alpha.37 turns the
logo stripe and the app accent blue (#42a5f5). Alpha.38 adds Settings →
Network (downloads Wi-Fi-only by default, ask-before-streaming on
cellular), automatic reconnection after network loss on both platforms,
an Android background-download progress notification, and the bundled
demo-movie data map for a fast first play. Alpha.42/.43 add the left
library drawer and the "My lists | Auto by type" arrangement toggle
(virtual Movies / TV Shows lists; the toggle was removed again after
alpha.66 — it hid custom lists with no TMDB match, so browsing is
always the user's own lists) plus per-list browse pages with
multi-select genre filter chips (since the post-alpha.66 changes the
Uncategorised chip only appears when the list also has categorised
items, and the list editor curates entries in a show → season tree
with per-item/season/show remove and move-to-list). Alpha.48 seeds a full public-domain
poster wall (three rows with bundled artwork) on first run and adds a
file-size/format line ("480p H.264 · 570 MB") to cards and detail
pages; alpha.49 folds same-title uploads into one card with an
"N versions" line and a detail-page version dropdown. Alpha.50 settles
the home app bar layout: search icon far left, library-drawer hamburger
far right, and the settings icon removed from the bar (Settings lives
in the drawer). Alpha.51 adds the Favourites home row (heart on detail
pages, beside Download since alpha.52). Alpha.54 hides the mouse cursor
when the player controls fade. Alpha.55/.56 ship the Upload screen (named Publish until 2026-08-27)
and the Settings → Wallet section described above, plus the update-check
toggle and badge in Settings → About. Alpha.57 adds the detail-page
Edit details editor (pencil in the app bar): title/year/description
plus artwork from an image file, a 12-frame video-frame picker
(desktop), or the player's camera button; alpha.58 extends the pencil
to show and season pages with properly scoped editors, and alpha.59
adds a crop/zoom step after picking a poster frame. Alpha.60 adds the
first-launch Terms of Use accept gate (and its read-only page in
Settings → About) plus the upload quality explainer dialog. Alpha.61
adds the My W@tch drawer page described above (link/join with QR,
device presence, Sync now) with camera QR scanning on Android;
alpha.62 makes edits and full-quality artwork ride the same sync,
and alpha.63 extends it to TMDB metadata + posters for keyless
devices. Alpha.64/.65 split the content spaces: the private flow is
renamed Upload, and **Channels** arrive — amber-badged public signed
lists with a create ceremony, rights attestation, and subscribe-by-code
— rounded out in alpha.66–.70 with file-first publishing (Check TMDB
included), channel profiles (circular avatar + author on an info card,
mini avatars on cards/drawer/wall), and the own channel on the
creator's wall. Alpha.67/.68 rebuild curation: the list editor is a
show → season → episode tree with move/copy-to-list and version
nesting, Media + Channels live under Settings → CONTENT, and Settings →
Appearance adds dark/light/system colour schemes. Alpha.71 deletes the
home status bar in favour of three dot-status rows at the top of the
drawer (Autonomi / My W@tch / Channels, tap to navigate) plus a
Built-in x0x client screen with independent agent switches (merged into the Built-in clients page 2026-09-05, then into the Data page's 3-way pills 2026-09-06); alpha.74
consolidates cellular policy under Settings → Mobile data. Alpha.76–.79
add the music surfaces: square album cards (and artist collage cards
since alpha.80, adaptive to the album count) on the wall and list grids, the album page
with inline player (transport row, seek bar, glow-pulsing cover), the
artist page, and the one-flow batch Upload screen — match-review
carousel, QUALITY on the review page, needs-attention resume, and a
track-scope Edit details editor. Alpha.84 splits the music editors:
the album page's pencil edits the album (artist, name, year,
description, cover), the track editor edits that track only (title,
number, artist, artwork — shown on its rows, its detail page, and as
the cover while it plays), and upload/import list defaults follow the
media type (Music / TV Shows / Movies). Alpha.85–.92 are the
data-control and audio wave: adaptive streaming readahead, Offline
mode + auto-pause when idle, the per-component data usage counters,
`W@tch/<List>` download folders with a deletion-aware sweep, Android
background music with lock-screen controls, quality tiers aggregating
on every surface (one card, best downloaded version auto-selected,
watch position following across tiers), branded QR codes on every
share surface, a real audio player screen (artwork + transport instead
of a black video surface), short audio kept out of Continue Watching,
live network-stack versions under About, and the single Settings →
Network → Data page with 3-way Off | Wi-Fi | Wi-Fi + mobile pills for
the built-in clients. Alpha.93 adds the profiles surfaces described
above (Who's-w@tching picker, Settings → Profiles, kid gating) and the
Big Buck Bunny seed card with its three-tier version picker; alpha.94
the pinned desktop drawer and the wordmark-styled picker heading;
alpha.95 the Android TV launcher entry with the wall-card focus ring,
the Include-profiles export/import checkboxes, and the honest "Can't
reach the Autonomi network" playback overlay.
Still to come from this document: filter/sort + fast-scroller on
the grid, the full desktop keyboard map, mobile gestures, and the
10-foot TV layout (the TV launcher entry + D-pad focus ring shipped
in alpha.95).
